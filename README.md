### Featured Projects

[Real Estate Analysis](https://github.com/joa-kl/real_estate_analysis)

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Polish residential property advertisements from **Otodom.pl** (July 2023 - July 2024).

The analysis demonstrates my ability to:
- **Clean and preprocess** real-world real estate data
- **Perform univariate and bivariate analysis** to understand feature distributions and relationships
- **Create clear visualizations** for storytelling and insight discovery
- **Handle data anomalies** (e.g., outliers)
- **Engineer new features** (e.g., price per m²) for deeper analysis
